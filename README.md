## Area Filler For Mining Turtles

I do not completely understand math that well. So please, understand most of this was taking alternatives I should have not taken which led to this novice looking code. 

This is an old project I was working on when I use to host a small tekkit server. This works in certain conditions, however it's very likely it will skip steps that are needed or completely fail to comply. Maybe later I'll fix this up but for now I have no reason to finish it.
